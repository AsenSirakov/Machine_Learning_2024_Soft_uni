    "## **1.Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn, defined as the act of customers discontinuing their service [1], is a significant challenge faced by the telecommunications industry, where retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones [2]. Churn refers to the number of customers who leave a service provider over a certain period [3], and predicting which customers are likely to churn is critical to minimizing revenue losses [4]. The goal of churn prediction is to identify potential churners early, so that businesses can take proactive steps, such as offering personalized incentives and retention strategies, to keep them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telecom companies face high acquisition costs compared to retention costs [2], and predicting churn accurately can prevent the misallocation of resources. When the prediction of churn is incorrect, companies may waste money on customers who would not have left, while missing opportunities to retain those who were actually at risk. Studies show that acquisition costs can be up to five times higher than retention costs [5], making it crucial to target the right customers with retention efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of popularity of data-driven solutions, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to predict customer churn [6] based on historical data. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior, service usage, billing information, and other relevant factors like demographic features and more, machine learning models can provide insights that were previously difficult to capture through traditional methods. These predictive models allow businesses to effectively target at-risk customers, offering retention campaigns before the churn occurs [7].Using algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees and more, companies could gain valuable insights into customer behavior and identify the key factors that drive churn. Accurate churn prediction models can enable telecom companies to reduce churn rates, increase customer loyalty, and enhance profitability. [8]\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to improving churn prediction, feature selection and the identification of relevant factors that influence churn may be critical for building effective models. [9] Telecom customers churn for a variety of reasons, and these factors should be considered to develop personalized retention strategies. Machine learning models allow for a more realistic and targeted approach, splitting customers based on their churn risk and offering the companies to develop customized solutions to prevent them from leaving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore the factors that lead to customer churn in order to allocate resources on their improvement or to gain knowledge on where the resources could be spared and to develop a churn prediction model using machine learning algorithms, with the goal of helping telecom companies predict customer churn and improve customer retention strategies. For that we will be trying different ML algorithms in order to find and tune the best model for our goal - to find out which customers would churn so that resources and strategies are built for their retention and which wouldn't so that resources aren't misallocated into retaining a non churner."
